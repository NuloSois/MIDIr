# MIDIr

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP)

MIDI-based esolang made for fun, still not workable but available if someone actually knows how to implement it.

As i know next to nothing in programming, i'm just following some of the basic rules of C# since it's the only language i've worked on.



So, how do you write code on it ?

First you must use a program that can write MIDI files, be it any DAW with a Piano Roll (like FL Studio), a tracker with MIDI Support or a score/engraving program (like Musescore or Sibelius), you can manually edit the MIDI using a code editor but with a proper program it is more practical.

For example, this is the "Hello World" Program.

The MIDI is equivalent to ` Console.Write("Hello World")` in C#

The Dictionary goes as

There are some useful characters to keep in mind too

aditionally, the command also starts with an A Chord (with the root in A4), certain Chords are shorthands for Methods, Variables, etc. and they will have their own documentation further the road.
